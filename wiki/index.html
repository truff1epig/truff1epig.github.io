		<strong>Gorillaz</strong> are a British virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett. The band primarily consists of four animated members: Stuart "2-D" Pot, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, and Russel Hobbs. Their fictional universe is presented in music videos, interviews and short cartoons. In reality, Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor, and Gorillaz' music often features collaborations with a wide range of featured artists. Remi Kabaka Jr. became producer for the band in 2016 after several years providing the voice of Russel Hobbs and was listed as an official member alongside Albarn and Hewlett in the 2019 documentary Gorillaz: Reject False Icons.

			With Gorillaz, Albarn departed from the distinct Britpop of his band Blur, exploring a variety of musical styles including hip hop, electronic music, and world music through an "eccentrically postmodern" approach.[2] The band's 2001 debut album Gorillaz, which featured dub and Latin influences, went triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in Europe, with sales driven by the success of the album's lead single "Clint Eastwood". Their second studio album, Demon Days (2005), featuring a darker tone, went 6 times platinum in the UK[3] and double platinum in the US and spawned the successful lead single "Feel Good Inc.".

			The band's third album, Plastic Beach (2010), featured environmentalist themes, an electropop approach and an expanded roster of featured artists. Their fourth album, The Fall was recorded on the road during the Escape to Plastic Beach Tour and released on 25 December 2010. The band's fifth album, Humanz, was released after a 7-year hiatus on 28 April 2017.[7] Their sixth album, The Now Now (2018), featured stripped down production and a greater musical focus on Albarn. Gorillaz' latest project is Song Machine, a project which sees the band releasing new songs every month, with various different featured artists.[8] Gorillaz has presented itself live in a variety of different ways throughout the band's history, such as hiding the live band from the audience's view in the early years of the project, displaying holographic animated band members on stage via computer graphics and traditional live touring featuring a fully visible live band.

		<h2>History</h2>
		<h3>Creation (1990-1999)</h3>
		<p>
			Musician Damon Albarn and comic artist Jamie Hewlett met in 1990 when guitarist Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett's work, asked him to interview Blur, which Albarn and Coxon had recently formed.[15] The interview was published in Deadline magazine, home of Hewlett's comic strip Tank Girl. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was "arsey, a wanker;" and despite becoming acquaintances with the band, they often did not get on, especially after Hewlett began seeing Coxon's ex-girlfriend Jane Olliver.[15] Despite this, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat on Westbourne Grove in London in 1997.[16] Hewlett had recently broken up with Olliver and Albarn was at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica.[15]

			Although not released under the Gorillaz name, Albarn has said that "one of the first ever Gorillaz tunes" was Blur's 1997 single "On Your Own", which was released for their fifth studio album Blur.
		</p>
		<h3>Gorillaz (2000-03)</h3>
		<p>
			From 1998 to 2000, Albarn recorded for Gorillaz' self-titled debut album at his newly opened Studio 13 in London as well as at Geejam Studios in Jamaica.[21] The sessions resulted in the band's first release, the EP Tomorrow Comes Today, released on 27 November 2000, which consisted mostly of tracks which would later appear on the album and also included the band's first music video for "Tomorrow Comes Today", which introduced the virtual band members for the first time.
		</p>
		<h3>Demon Days (2004-07)</h3>
		<p>
			Albarn spent the majority of 2003 on tour with Blur in support of their newly released album Think Tank, however upon completion of the tour decided to return to Gorillaz, reuniting with Hewlett to prepare for a second album. Hewlett explained that the duo chose to continue Gorillaz to prove that the project was not "a gimmick": "If you do it again, it's no longer a gimmick, and if it works then we've proved a point."[38] The result was Demon Days, released on 11 May 2005. The album was another major commercial success, debuting at #1 on the UK Albums Charts and #6 on the US Billboard 200, and has since gone six times platinum in the UK,[39] double platinum in the United States,[40] and triple platinum in Australia[41], outperforming sales of the first album and becoming the band's most successful album to date.[42] The album's success was partially driven by the success of the lead single "Feel Good Inc." featuring hip-hop group De La Soul, which topped Billboard's Alternative Songs chart in the U.S. for eight consecutive weeks and was featured in a commercial for Apple's iPod.[43] The album was also supported by the later singles "Dare", "Dirty Harry", and the double A-side "Kids with Guns" / "El Mañana".

		<h3>Plastic Beach and The Fall</h3>
		<p>
			Albarn and Hewlett's next project together was the opera Monkey: Journey to the West based on the classical Chinese novel Journey to the West, which premiered at the 2007 Manchester International Festival. While not officially a Gorillaz project, Albarn mentioned in an interview that the project was "Gorillaz, really but we can't call it that for legal reasons."
		</p>
		<p>
			After completing work on Monkey in late 2007, Albarn and Hewlett began working on a new Gorillaz project entitled Carousel, described by Albarn as being about "the mystical aspects of Britain". Hewlett described Carousel in a 2008 interview as "even bigger and more difficult than Monkey... It’s sort of like a film but not with one narrative story. There’s many stories, told around a bigger story, set to music, and done in live action, animation, all different styles. Originally it was a film but now we think it’s a film and it’s a stage thing as well. Damon‘s written around 70 songs for it, and I’ve got great plans for the visuals."[63] The Carousel concept was eventually dropped with Albarn and Hewlett's work evolving into the third Gorillaz studio album Plastic Beach.
